# First Visualization and Analysis in GEE Write Up
Name: Claire Morehouse

The country I chose for this challenge is Madagascar. I chose it because it's a place I would one day like to visit. I found figuring out how to alter the script to be easy, but when it came to actually enacting that change I had a lot of trouble altering the boundaries because the order that the script lists longitude and latitude is the opposite from Google Maps, and that took me time to figure out. Otherwise, I had a lot of fun with this challenge and playing with GEE.
